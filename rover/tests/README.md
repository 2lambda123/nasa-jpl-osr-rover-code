The tests use Python's builtin `unittest` module and have no dependencies.

# Running tests

On your terminal, `cd` into test directory and run the command `python -m unittest discover`. This will run all unit tests in the directory.
To run specific tests, type `python -m unittest -v module-name` where `module-name` is the name of the file you want to target for testing.

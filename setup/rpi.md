# Setting up the Raspberry Pi (RPi)

In this section, weâ€™ll go over setting up the Raspberry Pi (RPi) and setting up all the code that will run the rover. Our rover uses ROS (Robotic Operating System); we will set these up below.

These instructions should work for both the RPi 3 and 4. You are free to use other versions of RPi, ROS, or OS, but setting these up is not covered here and it is not guaranteed that those will work.

## 1 Installing an Operating System

The first step is to install Raspberry Pi OS on your RPi. Other OS'es like Ubuntu will also work but might require deviation from the instructions. We recommend using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#using-raspberry-pi-imager) to load the OS onto an SD card. If done right, you won't need an external monitor, mouse, or keyboard to set up your RPi!

Make sure you set the following settings while configuring the image to be flashed onto the SD card (ctrl/cmd+shift+x):

* Select `Enable SSH` to you can connect to the rover over your local WiFi connection rather than having to attach a screen, keyboard, and mouse to the RPi each time. We recommend using a password.
* `Set username and password`. You will need these later to log into the RPi over SSH.
* `Configure wifi` so the RPi knows how to connect to your network when it boots up. 
* `Set locale settings` to your time zone

When done flashing, insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi. When the Raspberry Pi is powered (make sure to use a proper power supply or connect it to the rover), it should connect to the WiFi connection and be visible from your router's 'devices' page. If possible, we recommend assigning a static IP address to your RPi so you can reach it using that IP address. Otherwise you should also be able to reach it using its hostname (which you selected in the Imager process), potentially with `.local` appended to the end.

From another computer, try connecting to the Raspberry Pi using SSH. You should be able to do so from a terminal in Windows, Linux, or MacOS using the following syntax: `ssh user@machine`, where the user is the username you set during the SD card flashing process earlier. For example:

```
ssh osr_user@raspberrypi.local
ssh alfred@192.168.1.17
```

It should prompt for your password and then form a connection to a terminal window on the RPi!

## 3 Installing ROS

We'll install ROS2 (Robot Operating System) on the RPi. If you're new to ROS, we recommend learning it as it is a crucial part in the code base.

You'll need to be logged in to the RPi via ssh, or open a terminal in the desktop GUI if you're connected via a monitor and mouse/keyboard.

Follow the [instructions](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Humble/Linux-Install-Debians/) for installing ROS2. 

**NOTE**: Depending on which version of Raspberry Pi OS you installed, you might need to install a [different version of ROS2](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html). 

You can choose to either install the 'full version' (`sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop`
) which comes with graphical packages like RViz and QT or install just the barebones version (`sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-base`). The latter
allows you to install packages in the full version whenever you need them.

## 4 Setting up ROS environment and building the rover code

### 4.1 Setup ROS build environment

First we'll create a ROS workspace for the rover code. 

```
# Create a colcon workspace directory, which will contain all ROS compilation and 
# source code files, and navigate into it
mkdir -p ~/osr_ws/src && cd ~/osr_ws

# Source your newly created ROS environment. If you get "No such file or directory", either you have not installed ROS2 properly, or the environment variables aren't set correctly. Ask for help on Slack on the troubleshooting channel.
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
```

### 4.2 Clone and build the rover code
For this section, you'll be working with the version control software `git`. Now's a good time to [read up](https://try.github.io/) on how that works if you're new to it and make a GitHub account!
In the newly created colcon workspace you just made, clone this repo:

```commandline
sudo apt install git
cd ~/osr_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code.git
cd osr-rover-code
git fetch origin
git checkout v2-humble

# install the dependencies using rosdep
sudo apt install python3-rosdep
cd ..
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=humble
# build the ROS packages
colcon build --symlink-install
```
It should run successfully. If it doesn't, please ask on Slack or [submit an issue](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code/issues/new).

Now let's add the generated files to the path so ROS can find them
```
source install/setup.bash
```

The rover has some customizable settings that will overwrite the default values. 
Whether you have any changes compared to the defaults or not, you have to manually create these files:
```
cd ~/osr_ws/src/osr-rover-code/ROS/osr_bringup/config
touch osr_params_mod.yaml roboclaw_params_mod.yaml
```

To change any values from the default (if your rover doesn't match the default instructions), modify these files (the _mod.yaml ones) instead if the original ones. This way your changes don't get committed to git. 
The files follow the same structure as the default. Just include the values that you need to change as the default
values for other parameters may change over time.

You might also want to modify the file `osr-rover-code/ROS/osr_bringup/launch/osr_mod_launch.py` to change the velocities the gamepad controller will
send to the rover. These values in the node joy_to_twist are of interest:
```
    {"scale_linear": 0.8},  # scale to apply to drive speed, in m/s: drive_motor_rpm * 2pi / 60 * wheel radius * slowdown_factor
    {"scale_angular": 1.75},  # scale to apply to angular speed, in rad/s: scale_linear / min_radius
    {"scale_linear_turbo": 1.78},  # scale to apply to linear speed, in m/s
```
The maximum speed your rover can go is determined by the no-load speed of your drive motors. The default no-load speed is located
in the file [osr_params.yaml](../ROS/osr_bringup/config/osr_params.yaml) as `drive_no_load_rpm`, unless you modified it in the corresponding `_mod.yaml` file. 
This maximum speed corresponds to `scale_linear_turbo` and can be calculated as `drive_no_load_rpm * 2pi / 60 * wheel radius (=0.075m)`.
Based on this upper limit, let's set our regular moving speed to a sensible fraction of that which you can configure to your liking.
Start with e.g. 0.75 * scale_linear_turbo. If you think it's too slow or too fast, simply scale it up or down.

The turning speed of the rover, just like a regular car, depends on how fast it's going. As a result, `scale_angular`
should be set to `scale_linear / min_radius`. For the default configuration, the `min_radius` equals `0.45m`.

### 4.3 Add ROS config scripts to .bashrc

The `source...foo.bash` lines above are used to manually configure your ROS environment. We can do this automatically in the future by doing:
```
cd ~
echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc 
echo "source ~/osr_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
This adds the `source` lines to `~/.bashrc`, which runs whenever a new shell is opened on the RPi - by logging in via ssh, for example. So, from now on, when you log into the RPi your new command line environment will have the appropriate configuration for ROS and the rover code.


## 5 Setting up serial communication on the RPi

The RPi will talk to the motor controllers over serial.

### 5.1 Disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

Because we are using the serial port for communicating with the roboclaw motor controllers, we have to disable the serial-getty@ttyS0.service service. This service has some level of control over serial devices that we use, so if we leave it on it we'll get weird errors ([source](https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3-4/)). Note that the masking step was suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43633467/4292910). It seems to be necessary for some setups of the rpi4 - just using `systemctl disable` won't cut it for disabling the service.

**Note that the following will stop you from being able to communicate with the RPi over the serial, wired connection. However, it won't affect communication with the rpi with SSH over wifi.**

```
sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
sudo systemctl mask serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```

### 5.2 Copy udev rules

Now we'll need to copy over a udev rules file, which is used to configure needed device files in `/dev`; namely, `ttyS0 and ttyAMA0`. Here's a [good primer](http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html) on udev. 

```
# copy udev file from the repo to your system
cd ~/osr_ws/src/osr-rover-code/config
sudo cp serial_udev_ubuntu.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules

# reload the udev rules so that the devices files are set up correctly.
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

This configuration should persist across RPi reboots.

### 5.3 Add user to tty and dialout groups

Finally, add the user to the `tty` and `dialout` groups:
```
sudo adduser $USER tty
sudo adduser $USER dialout
```
You might have to create the dialout group if it doesn't already exist.

<!-- You'll need to log out of your ssh session and log back in for this to take effect. Or you can reboot. -->

## 6 Testing serial comm with the Roboclaw motors controllers

Run the roboclawtest.py script with all of the motor addresses:
```
cd ~/osr_ws/src/osr-rover-code/scripts
python3 roboclawtest.py 128
python3 roboclawtest.py 129
python3 roboclawtest.py 130
```
Each of these should output something like, within a very short execution time:
```
(1, 'USB Roboclaw 2x7a v4.1.34\n')
(1, 853, 130)
```

If the script seems to hang, or returns only zeros inside the parantheses, then you have a problem communicating with the given roboclaw for that address. Some troubleshooting steps in this cases:

- Make sure you followed the instructions in the "Setting up serial communication" section above, and the serial devices are configured correctly on the RPi.
- Also make sure you went through the calibration instructions from the [main repo](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/Electrical/Calibration.pdf) and set the proper address, serial comm baud rate, and "Enable Multi-Unit Mode" option for every roboclaw controller (if multi-unit mode isn't enabled on every controller, there will be serial bus contention.). If you update anything on a controller, you'll need to fully power cycle it by turning the rover off.
- If you're still having trouble after the above steps, try unplugging every motor controller except for one, and debug exclusively with that one.
